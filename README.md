EcoPlan - Project Overview

The primary aim of my SPA called EcoPlan is to help individuals build and maintain healthy habits with sustainable actions. The project is built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end and JSON for user data storage. 
The application lets users set personal goals and keep track of their habit progress. Other added features include notification alerts for habit reminders, a light and dark mode for comfortable usage, and data syncing through login and sign-up functionalities.
EcoPlan follows the traditional SDLC, applying Agile values for incremental improvement. The design process had UML diagrams, wireframes, and research about best practices for user experience. 
This project is a simple yet effective tool to help individuals take control of their well-being. EcoPlan thus helps people turn awareness into action with the possibility of attaining sustainable and long-term lifestyle changes.
